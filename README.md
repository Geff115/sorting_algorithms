This is a team project.

Team:
	- Gabriel Effangha.
	- Claire Marie Senga.


For this project:
	- All our source code files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
	- All our code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
	- We are not allowed to use global variables.
	- We have no more than 5 functions per file.
	- The prototype of all our functions are included in the header file sort.h.
